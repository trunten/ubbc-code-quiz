# Code Quiz Challenge

## Description

I was given the task of creating a simple, interactive coding quiz to test the users knowledge of basic JavaScript concepts.

### User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 - Questions contain buttons for each answer. 
 - When answer is clicked, the next question appears 
 - If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
-The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
 - When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to ***save*** their initials and their score

The application will be completed when all of the above criteria are met. The app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
